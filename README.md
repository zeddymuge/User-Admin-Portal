# Angular User Management Dashboard

## Objective

The Angular User Management Dashboard is a web application that allows users to manage user profiles efficiently. It provides features for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting user profiles, seamlessly integrated with a dummy API. This project demonstrates the effective use of TypeScript for type-safe development and the handling of HTTP requests.

## Features

### User List Page

- Display a list of users, showcasing their:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Role

- Each user entry offers convenient options to:
  - Edit user information
  - Delete user profiles

- A user-friendly button is provided to add new users.

- If the API returns numerous users, pagination functionality is implemented for ease of navigation.

### Add/Edit User Form

### Error Handling

- User-friendly error messages are displayed in case an API call fails, ensuring a seamless user experience.
